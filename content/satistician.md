## What Is GITMIS?
Ghana Integrated Tax Management and Information System (GITMIS) is an end-to-end Enterprise application developed to manage tax administration for the Ghana Revenue Authority.  
GITMIS 3 is a very capable Tax Information Management System that captures all aspects of Tax Administration in Ghana. GITMIS 3 makes use of the data points captured in the system to provide essential information for easy decision making.  

It is basically a management and decision support system. The focus of GITMIS 3 is to determine or predict the Tax Compliance of taxpayers in a more targeted manner using the easily accessible data. As no efficient tax management system works in isolation, GITMIS 3 is designed and developed with integration and interoperability as one of the core considerations.
